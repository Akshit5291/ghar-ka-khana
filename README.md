## Tech Stack & Architecture

This project follows a client-server architecture. The Flutter mobile app (client) communicates with a Node.js backend via a RESTful API. The backend handles business logic, authentication, and interacts with the database and third-party services.

*   **Frontend (Mobile):** Flutter (Dart)
*   **Backend (Server):** Node.js, Express.js
*   **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
*   **Cloud Storage:** AWS S3 (for user uploads, meal images, and documents)
*   **APIs & Services:**
    *   Google Maps API / Geolocation (for location services)
    *   Razorpay API (for payment processing)
    *   Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) (for push notifications)
*   **Environment Variables:** Managed using `dotenv`

## Local Development Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project for development on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
*   **Flutter SDK:** (Latest stable version) [Install Guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
*   **Node.js & npm:** (v16 or higher) [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
*   **MongoDB:** (Local instance or MongoDB Atlas cloud URI)
*   **Git**

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Akshit5291/ghar-ka-khana.git
    cd ghar-ka-khana
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the backend directory
    cd server

    # Install all dependencies
    npm install

    # Create a .env file from the provided template and configure your variables
    cp .env.example .env
    # Now edit the .env file with your actual values (database URI, API keys, etc.)

    # Start the development server
    npm run dev
    ```
    The backend server should now be running on `http://localhost:3000` (or your specified `PORT`).

3.  **Frontend (Flutter App) Setup:**
